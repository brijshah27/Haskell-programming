--Possible question: What would happen if we reversed the order of the two myMap1 clauses?:l 
--Possible question: Is myMap1 tail recursive? Why or why not?

--Possible question: Show how this works by stepping through the execution.

--Possible question: If you use recursion, does the order of the clauses matter? Why or why not?

--Possible question: This is tail recursive. Why or why not? 
--Possible question: What is the relationship between the value produced by the base case and the initial function call? 
--That is, assume you make a call like this:
-- > myFoldl fn accInit list
--and assume that when the base case is reached it returns value
--What is the relationship (if any) between value and myFoldl fn accInit list?

myFoldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

--Possible question: This is tail recursive. Why or why not? 
--Possible question: What is the relationship between the value produced by the base case and the initial function call?

myCycle :: [a] -> [a]
myCycle a = a ++ myCycle a
--Possible question: Why doesnâ€™t this lead to an infinite loop?
--Possible question: What happens with the following? Explain why.
cyc12 = myCycle [1,2]
-- > take 5 cyc12
--Possible question: Walk through the step-by-step execution of 
-- > take 5 (myCycle [1,2])
